# Release

Cut a new release for claude-code-homeassistant-hermit.

## Steps

### 1. Read current version

Read `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and extract `version`.

### 2. Ask for bump and changelog

Single `AskUserQuestion` with two questions:

```
questions: [
  {
    header: "Version bump",
    question: "Current version is X.Y.Z. What kind of release?",
    options: [
      { label: "patch (X.Y.Z+1)", description: "Bug fixes, copy changes, naming corrections" },
      { label: "minor (X.Y+1.0)",  description: "New skills, agents, or behaviour" },
      { label: "major (X+1.0.0)", description: "Breaking changes or architectural shift" }
    ]
  },
  {
    header: "Changelog",
    question: "Changelog body for this release (markdown, no version header needed):"
  }
]
```

Compute new version from the answer.

### 3. Update files

1. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — `"version": "OLD"` → `"version": "NEW"`
2. `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — `"version": "OLD"` → `"version": "NEW"`
3. `README.md` — badge segment `version-OLD-green` → `version-NEW-green` and alt text `Version OLD` → `Version NEW`
4. `CHANGELOG.md` — prepend after the `# Changelog` heading:

```
## [NEW] - YYYY-MM-DD

<changelog body>

---
```

Use today's date.

### 4. Commit and push

```bash
git add .claude-plugin/plugin.json .claude-plugin/marketplace.json README.md CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "vNEW — <one-line summary from first line of changelog body>"
git push
```

If no upstream is set: `git push --set-upstream origin main`.

### 5. Confirm

```

  plugin.json       ✓
  marketplace.json  ✓
  README.md badge   ✓

  Pushed            ✓
