# HA Morning Brief

A house-focused morning brief that combines live HA state with hermit session context. Designed to run as the `morning` routine at start of day.

## Delivery Guard

Before doing any work, read `.claude-code-hermit/state/runtime.json` if it exists.

- If `session_state` is `waiting`: the operator is absent. Check `config.json` for a configured Discord channel.
  - Discord channel present → proceed, deliver via Discord only (skip terminal output).
  - No Discord channel → suppress entirely (log `morning-brief skipped: session_state=waiting, no channel` to SHELL.md Monitoring and exit).
- Otherwise: proceed normally.

## Steps

1. **Time & context** — Call `GetDateTime` for current time. Read `.claude-code-hermit/OPERATOR.md` for priorities and language preferences.

2. **Live house snapshot** — Call `GetLiveContext`. Extract and organize:
   - Presence (who is home/away)
   - Lights still on (unexpected at morning time?)
   - Cover/blind positions
   - Climate: indoor temps, HVAC mode
   - Any devices unavailable or in error state
   - Security: alarm state (read-only)

3. **Energy snapshot** — From the live context, pull current power draw and any energy sensors. Compare with known baselines from memory if available. Flag anything unusual (e.g., high overnight consumption).

4. **Context freshness** — Check `.claude-code-hermit/raw/snapshot-ha-context-latest.json` modification time. If older than 24h, note it as stale.

5. **Overnight activity** — Read `.claude-code-hermit/sessions/SHELL.md`. Scan both the **Monitoring** section and the **Findings** section (last 20 lines combined). In newborn-phase hermits (< 3 days old), pattern observations land in Findings as `Noticed: <pattern>` entries — include those. Surface any alerts or notable patterns found overnight.

6. **Cost-spike check** — Read `.claude-code-hermit/state/reflection-state.json` if it exists. Look for any `cost_spike` entry with a timestamp within the last 24 hours. If found, include a "Cost alert" bullet in the brief with the flagged amount.

7. **Pending work** — Scan for:
   - `Glob` for `.claude-code-hermit/proposals/PROP-*.md` — read status from each, list any `pending` proposals
   - Check if `.claude-code-hermit/sessions/NEXT-TASK.md` exists (queued task)
   - Read `.claude-code-hermit/cost-summary.md` if it exists — include yesterday's cost

8. **Compose brief** — Write a concise morning brief in the operator's language (from OPERATOR.md preferences). Use the format below.

## Output Format

```
Bom dia! Casa - [date]

Estado actual:
- [presence, lights, climate, covers - concise bullets]

Energia:
- [current draw, overnight highlights]

Alertas:
- [devices offline, unusual states, or "Tudo normal"]

Pendente:
- [proposals, queued tasks, or "Nada pendente"]

Custo:
- [yesterday's cost if available; cost-spike alert if flagged by reflect]

Prioridades hoje:
- [from OPERATOR.md Current Priority, filtered to actionable items]
```

Adapt the greeting and section headers to the operator's configured language. Keep the entire brief under 25 lines.

## Delivery

- If invoked from a Discord channel context: send via `reply` to that channel
- If invoked as a routine and `session_state` is `waiting` with a Discord channel configured: send via Discord only
- If invoked as a routine (no channel context, operator present): output to terminal only
- Never include secrets, tokens, or internal file paths in the brief
